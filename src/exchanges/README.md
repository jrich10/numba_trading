# Current Exchanges

## FTX 
- Needs to be cleaned up. It's pretty unorganized. But now that the exchange is dead
I did'nt want to waste my time with it. The overall logic can be applied to other exchanges. Dydx version is a little cleaner but doesn't use ccxt.

## Local
- This is for calculating local trades when running backtests and simulations

## DYDX
- Untested but should work. I would make sure you test it before putting any real money on it. That being said you should do that with everything in this repo.
